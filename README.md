# LMS Portal - A Learning Management System

Welcome to the LMS Portal, a full-featured Learning Management System (LMS) built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This platform enables instructors to create, manage, and track courses, while students can browse, enroll, and track their learning progress. The system includes secure authentication using JWT, and students can enroll in courses, track progress, and make payments.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: React.js, Axios, React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose (for schema modeling)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Payment Integration**: Optional integration with payment systems like Stripe or Razorpay

## Getting Started

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (with npm) - You can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB** - Either set up MongoDB locally or use **MongoDB Atlas** for cloud hosting.

### Installation

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lms-portal.git
cd lms-portal

Step 2: Set Up Backend
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend
Install backend dependencies:

npm install
Create a .env file inside the backend folder and add your environment variables:

env
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
Run the backend server:

bash
npm run dev
Your backend server should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

Step 3: Set Up Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
cd frontend
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
npm install
Create a .env file in the frontend folder and add your API URL:

env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
Run the frontend server:

npm start
Your frontend will now be running at http://localhost:3000.
